Hello, Linuxers.

You can find the sources of Conor P. Cahill's debugging malloc 
library (Version 1.14) patched for Linux 0.99.5 and libc 4.3 in 

	/pub/incomming 
at 
	ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de 

now. It would be very nice if you distribute it over the net. Here 
is what Conor writes about it (I've taken that from his README):

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package is a collection of routines which are a drop-in replacement
for the malloc(3), memory(3), string(3), and bstring(3) library functions.
These replacement modules are different from the original modules in that
they provide a full set of debugging features which detect malloc 
memory overruns and other types of misuse.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've made some short tests running the included test programs, but
I don't know if I've found and fixed all pitfalls. At least one 
pitfall still exists (a problem with exit() and _exit() which may
result in an infinite loop), but I will write a message obout it in 
comp.os.linux.

There are also debugging functions for XWindow applications (XtMalloc, 
XtFree, etc.). Take a look at README.Linux about that.

I have checked the X specific stuff by debugging xdtm-2.5. Xdtm is full 
of bugs, and a lot of them have nothing to do with malloc(). It should 
never be distributed. Please don't ask me to send you a debugged version 
of it. PERHAPS I will put a fixed version on the net.

Dbmalloc is very usefull. After a very short time you may wonder how ever 
you came along without it.


Have fun.
